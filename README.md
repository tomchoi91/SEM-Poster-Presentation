### Abstract

In this study, Monte Carlo methods were used to investigate the impact on fit indexes of varying 
sample size, model size, model type, and degree of model misspecification. 
Monte Carlo simulation is one of statistical techniques that use pseudo-random sampling (e.g., 
pulling random numbers from the given distribution) to derive approximate solutions to a variety 
of mathematical problems.


This study specifically addresses the sensitivity of various fit indices to various model modeling 
conditions such as sample size, model size, model type, and degree of model misspecification. 
Previous literatures have provided the guidelines for which fit indices must be used and proposed 
cutoff criteria for those fit indexes in model fit assessment. According to Hu and Bentler (1998), a 
good index should approach its maximum under correct specification but also degrade 
substantially under misspecification. It also should be sensitive to model misspecification, but not 
to types of models.


Recently, however, many fit indices are found not only to be sensitive to model misspecification 
(desirable), but also be sensitive to other modeling conditions such as types of model (e.g., CFA, 
SR, or LGM; undesirable), model complexity, and sample sizes, thus invalidating the previously 
proposed cutoff criteria. Therefore, this study revisits the notion of so-called global cutoff for 
model fit indices and examine the performance of those indices while considering relevant 
factors.


The results were consistent with the findings from Fan & Sivo (2007) to the some degrees, but 
did not perfectly replicate them. Implications and Limitations are discussed at the end.
